## Features
- **üñºÔ∏è Designs**. There are three components that make up the designs:
    - **Mode**. Context's colors. *Light* or *Dark* mode.
    - **Shape**. Element's shape. *Square* or *Circle*.
    - **Box Shadow**. The shadow(s) attached to the element.
- **üìô Collection**. When logging with a Github account you can save a design to your collection. They'll appear in your collection tab (within your account) and at the gallery.
- **ü§è Drag and drop code**. It is possible to drag and drop the lines on the terminal to change shadow's positioning. Try it!
- **üé¥ Social Cards**. When saving a new design, it will be automatically added to the gallery gaining a customized open graph image. (On Twitter sometimes needs to be validated first [here](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator))

 </div>

üí° *Tip*: In case you need to fill the element with a color, just add a new shadow with `Inset` *marked* and `Color Opacity`, `Blur Radius` and `Spread Radius` set to *maximum*.

  git clone https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/box-shadow.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```
